# Codes for FoldX towards Stable Proteins

### See [old version](arxiv/) for previous version.

This repo will be updated within days, no more gui will be provided. However, the scoring will be more efficient and accurate since I changed `PositionScan` to `BuildModel`. In each run of `BuildModel`, 10 models will be built by default. Also in the final report, `mean ∆∆G` and `SD` will be recorded.
