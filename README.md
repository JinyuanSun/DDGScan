**I am testing this repo with some different input structures, if you encountered any failure please post a issue.**

## The GUI plugin for FoldX

[GUI](GUI/) only work for FoldX.

## Installation

First of all, please make sure you have added the **FoldX** executable to your environment! Secondly, **Rosetta**
(a mpi build is necessary otherwise the `relax` step will be skiped) is
required for cartesian_ddg (`-mode slow`) calculation or ddg_monomer row1 protocol(`-mode fast`).
Also, **ABACUS** is an outstanding software with great statistical energy function for protein design.
Structures downloaded from RCSB could be erroneous. One of the biggest problems that will directly affect energy calculation is breaks in chains.
Here I implemented a loop closure module using **modeller**, a great software with a very long history, as backend.
Due to their licenses, I cannot redistribute them here :worried: !  
To our glad, **openmm** is open source! So the glass is half full :smiley: .
Here is a good news, the **ABACUS2** database is now available at <https://zenodo.org/record/4533424>. However, the necessary
module is not available in the zenodo version, you may use the online server at <https://biocomp.ustc.edu.cn/servers/abacus-design.php> to run ABACUS2.

**Install DDGScan**

```shell
conda create -n ddgscan python=3.8
conda activate ddgscan
git clone https://github.com/JinyuanSun/DDGScan.git
pip install pandas numpy joblib seaborn matplotlib venn logomaker mdtraj bio
python setup.py install
DDGScan -h # you should see help message
```
  
**Install OpenMM and pdbfixer with Conda**:

To avoid possilbe confilcts, create a new conda environment:

```shell
conda activate ddgscan
conda install -c conda-forge openmm pdbfixer
```

**FoldX**

[Register](https://foldxsuite.crg.eu/) and download the executable.

**Rosetta**

Follow the [Rosetta document](https://new.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/install_build/install_buildhttps://new.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/install_build/install_build)  
I will recommend that users export `ROSETTADB` before runing `grape-fast.py` by appending this into `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ROSETTADB="/path/to/rosetta/database"
```

**ABACUS1/2**

Send email to the authors for source code.

**Modeller**

Get the Modeller license key at <https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html>

```bash
export KEY_MODELLER=<your_key>
conda config --add channels salilab
conda install modeller
```

## Usage

### Grape phase I

I provide many options for users especially those know what they want. Here are some quick walk-through. `pdb` and `chain` are positional but  you need to set
`-E` according to the software you have in your OS. `-seq` are strongly recommended to be set by the user.
Also, I highly recommend adding the `-MD` flag and using `-P CUDA` if a good gpu is available (better
 than RTX2060 well be much faster than 48 core cpu). Also, I did not test how much precision dropped to use the `-S fast`
 preset, but I do know it can be faster in about two orders of magnitude.  
 If using `-fill` flag, input structure will be automatically fixed using information from SEQRES record in native PDB
 downloaded from RCSB using modeller. Model with lowest `molpdf` energy will be subjected to following step.

                        plots you want to make

```

## QuickStart

### Grape phase I

You may want to try it out on a small protein like [Gb1](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1PGA):  
I will recommend using the `-S fast` with `-MD` flag, and using `CUDA` to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations.
This is a very good crystal structure solved by X-ray, so I did not pass any value about fixing the PDB file!  
Using `-S slow` to get more accuracy!

```bash
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/1PGA.pdb
DDGScan grape_phaseI 1PGA.pdb A -E foldx abaucs rosetta -M run -T 40 -S slow -MD -P CUDA
```

You should expecting outputs like:  
A folder named `foldx_results` containing:

```
All_FoldX.score
MutationsEnergies_BestPerPositionBelowCutOff_SortedByEnergy.tab
MutationsEnergies_BelowCutOff.tab
MutationsEnergies_BestPerPosition_SortedByEnergy.tab
MutationsEnergies_BelowCutOff_SortedByEnergy.tab
MutationsEnergies_CompleteList.tab
MutationsEnergies_BestPerPosition.tab
MutationsEnergies_CompleteList_SortedByEnergy.tab
MutationsEnergies_BestPerPositionBelowCutOff.tab
```

And another folder named `foldx_jobs` contains many subdirectories, in each subdirectory, containing raw output for
every mutation built by FoldX. Of course, there will be directories start with rosetta or abacus, depending on your choice!  
If `-md` was turned on, all produced snapshots can be found in `selectpdb` with `afterMD` as a suffix in the name of PDB files.

### Support for homo-multimer interface mutation modelling

In some cases, one may need to redesign a multimer for biocatalysis. For homo-multimer, we need to manage mutations at symmetrical interfaces. To reduce the required computing resources, DDGScan treats homo-multimer as a monomer for 1st round prediction. And putative beneficial mutations located at the interface will be selected for further prediction, and multiple mutations will be made on the entire multimer.

```bash
multimer_scan.py multimer.pdb
```

#### Inspect structures

Using `scripts/inspectmutation.py` to inspect mutations in pymol:

```bash
pymol inspectmutation.py $Wildtype_structure $Mutation_structure $Mutation_position $Chain
```

About principles for protein physics, refer to  [this book](https://u1lib.org/book/2801005/141419).

### List distribute

For a given set of single-point mutations of a protein. This module distributes calculations to cores and can parse
pre-defined special groups of mutations to make.

```
# followings are pre-defined groups:
    _small: GAVSTC
    _large: FYWKRHQE
    _neg: DE
    _pos: RK
    _polar: YTSHKREDQN
    _non_charged_polar: YTSNQH
    _hydrophobic: FILVAGMW
    _cys: C
    _pro: P
    _scan: ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV
```

Also, "dynamic selection" are supported.

```
# followings are dynamic selection:
    @smaller: mutation to AA with smaller vdw
    @bigger: mutation to AA with bigger vdw
    @more_hydrophobic: mutation to AA more hydrophobic
    @less_hydrophobic: mutation to AA more hydrophilic
    @more_sheet_tendency: mutation to AA with higher sheet tendency
    @less_sheet_tendency: mutation to AA with lower sheet tendency
    @more_helix_tendency: mutation to AA with higher helix tendency
    @less_helix_tendency: mutation to AA with lower helix tendency
    @{random}: random is an integer in range 1 to 19 ,randomly select few mutations for you, good luck!
```

An example mutation list file is a plain text file seperated with space,
looks like:

```
wildtype chain position mutation
A A 26 P
A A 26 ILV # make A -> I,L,V
A A 26 _polar # make A -> Y,T,S,H,K,R,E,D,Q,N
A A 26 @9
A A 26 @smaller # make A -> G
```

DDGScan also support MSAddg output, you need to add a `-msaddg` flag. The best 80 predictions made by MSAddg will be
selected.

```bash
DDGScan list_distribute 1pga.pdb 1pga.fa.scan.txt -repair -msaddg -T 10 -E foldx
```

### Analysis *in silico* screening results

Post analysis can help you to easily access to many kinds of plots.
Here are two example of a bar-plot of a saturated single point mutation and mutation logo sequence.

Continuing...


## Known Issues

To avoid issues caused by pdb file, it is recommended to carefully exam your input file. One can
use `/path/to/rosetta/main/tools/protein_tools/scripts/clean_pdb.py`
to clean pdb. However, this script will also renumber pdb file.
During test, some cases failed because of the following problems:

* Non-canonical amino acid in pdb will cause failure due to lack parameters in all predictors, therefore is not accepted.
* Gaps in pdb introduce ugly energy, you may want to apply `-fill` or use model predicted by AlphaFold. Based on some case study and reports from the community, the AF2 structrue is prefectly OK as a good start point.
