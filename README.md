# Codes for FoldX towards Stable Proteins

### See [old version](arxiv/) for previous version.

This repo will be update within days, no more gui will be provided. However the scoring will be more effeicent and accurate since I changed `PositionScan` to `BuildModel`.  
In each run of `BuildModel`, 10 models will be built by default. Also in the final report, Mean ddG and SD will be recorded.
